# esd-js
An implementation of ESD in javascript.

## About
ESD is a function designed to determine the (best case) standard deviations necessary in order to get a certain percent in a given rhythm game.

You must provide the judgements for the game, including the value they are worth and the milisecond border required to hit them in.
Some defaults, such as iidx, are built in.
